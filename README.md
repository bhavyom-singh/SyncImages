# SyncImages

As the name suggest, this script sync images from source folder to destination folder.

How it works?
It will first ask you for source folder and then the destination folder.
As soon as you press enter, images will start syncing from source to destination folder.

This script can also be extended for syncing files also, based on their names and extension.
